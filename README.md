CLPSO
=====

CLPSO uses a novel learning strategy whereby all other particles’ historical best information
is used to update a particle’s velocity. This strategy enables the
diversity of the swarm to be preserved to discourage premature
convergence. Experiments were conducted (using codes available
from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/epnsugan) on multimodal test
functions such as Rosenbrock, Griewank, Rastrigin, Ackley,
and Schwefel and composition functions both with and without
coordinate rotation. The results demonstrate good performance of
the CLPSO in solving multimodal problems when compared with
eight other recent variants of the PSO.
